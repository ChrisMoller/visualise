vis is an interactive function visualisr.  Given input like

setvar x [-7.0, 2.2]

setctrl Amplitude 1.0 [-2, 2]
setctrl Phase 0.0 [-2, 2]

"cos" {colour = "blue"} Amplitude * cos(Phase + x)

it will plot the given curve across the given range of x ([-7.0, 2.2]) and
provide controls that allow the user to vary the given control variables
Amplitude and Phase across the given ranges with the given initial values.

Any number of curves can be shown simultaneously, using any number of control
variables.  See the src/tests directory for a couple of examples (test.vis and
test2.vis) and a longer description of the input file format.


Usage:
  vis [OPTION...] string string string...

Help Options:
  -h, --help               Show help options
  --help-all               Show all help options
  --help-gtk               Show GTK+ Options

Application Options:
  -c, --complex            Complex display mode.
  -s, --source             <file>  Source file.
  -e, --expr               <expr>  Expression.
  -f, --fonts              List available fonts.
  --display=DISPLAY        X display to use


The -c option specifies how complex values are to be interpreted for plotting.
The following option arguments bay be supplied:

  real	      -- extract the real component
  imaginary   -- extract the imaginary component
  magnitude   -- extract the magnitude
  phase       -- extract the phase
  j           -- render the plot as a 3D projection (not yet implemented)

  All options may be in either or lower case, may be abbreviated their
  initial letter, and in fact may consist of any string that starts with
  that letter.

The -s option explicitly identifies the following argument as the filename
of a script to be executed.  The option may be used any number of times; if
used more than once, the scripts will be executed in the order specified.

The -e option explicitly identifies the following argument as a vis command
or expression.  The option may be used any number of times; if used more than
once, the commands will be executed in the order specified.

Any command-line arguments that aren't options will first be checked to see
if they're valid file names.  If they are, they'll be treated as if they're
script files, opened, and executed.  Otherwise they'll be executed as
commands.

All of the above can be mixed in any order.  If such a mix is specified,
non-option arguments will be examined first, followed by explicit command
option arguments, followed by explicit script option arguments.


COMMANDS

The following are valid vis commands:

    set label <options> location string

    where <options> is optional an consists of a series of one of more
    keyword/value pairs enclosed in curly braces ({....}).

    The keyword/value pairs are of the form

             keyword = value

    where the spaces are optional and ignored.

    The valid keywords are:

      colour (or colour)    The value may be expressed as:
      	     	 	      a common name such as "red",
			      a six-digit hexadecimal representation
			        such as "#ff0000" where the
			        are interpreted as #rrggbb,
			      a string of the form "rgb (r, g, b)"
			        where each value r, g, or b is a
				number in the range of 0 to 255,
				or is expressed as a percentage
				(e.g., "55%") in the range of
				0 to 100.  The string must be
				quoted only if its not of the
				form [[:alpha:]][[:alnum:]_]*
			      a string of the form "rgba (r, g, b)"
			        like the above but including an
				alpha value.

      angle		     Degrees counter clockwise from the
      			       at witch the string will be rendered.
			       The value must be quoted.

      stretch		     Additional pixel spacing to be inserted
      			       between rendered characters.  The value
			       must be quoted.

      font		     A string of very flexible form, typically
      			       such as "Sans Bold 12" or "Serif 16".
			       Must be quoted.
