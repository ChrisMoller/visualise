vis is an interactive function visualisr.  Given input like

setvar x [-7.0, 2.2]

setctrl Amplitude 1.0 [-2, 2]
setctrl Phase 0.0 [-2, 2]

"cos" {colour = "blue"} Amplitude * cos(Phase + x)

it will plot the given curve across the given range of x ([-7.0, 2.2]) and
provide controls that allow the user to vary the given control variables
Amplitude and Phase across the given ranges with the given initial values.

Any number of curves can be shown simultaneously, using any number of control
variables.  See the src/tests directory for a couple of examplss and a longer
description ofthe input file format.
